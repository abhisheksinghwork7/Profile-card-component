## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I cleared a lot og basic idea about padding and margins. I had to really study the basics to place 2 background images with custom setting. The css code for the same is given below: 
```css
 background-image: url("/images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg")  ;
    background-repeat: no-repeat,no-repeat;
    background-size: cover,cover;
    background-position: top -60vh left -120vw ,bottom -60vh right -120vw;
```


### Continued development

I found that there is need to study the properties and basic attributes of HTML5. The behaviour of each attributes and the values given does help in defing the page better.
